# 🎬 Movie Success Prediction and Analysis

This project aims to predict box office revenue based on various movie metadata features such as budget, genre, cast size, and release timing. It represents my first full data science project, combining data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression modelling.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand what factors influence movie revenue
- Clean and preprocess real-world movie data
- Build regression models to predict revenue
- Derive actionable insights through data visualisation

---

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed null values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats
   - Standardised categorical features such as genres and release dates

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Explored budget vs revenue relationships
   - Visualised trends by genre, release season, and popularity

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Applied log transformations to skewed features
   - Extracted release year and month
   - One-hot encoded categorical variables

4. **Model Building and Evaluation**  
   - Training and evaluating linear regression, decision tree, and random forest models
   - Used metrics such as RMSE and R² score to assess performance
